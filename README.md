# Tableau & Twilio via Webhooks

A project demonstrating the use of Tableau's [Webhooks API](https://www.tableau.com/developer/tools/webhook-api) and [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) to send notifications to a site or server administrator upon failed data source refreshes.

The app is capable of sending SMS, WhatsApp and perform phone calls when certain events take place on a Tableau Server or Tableau Online site.
